## About the Accessibility Evaluation Tool

The Accessibility Evaluation tool is an assistant that takes the user through the process of evaluating the accessibility of a website, using the [WCAG Evaluation Methodology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

It is initially developed as the [WAI WCAG-EM Report Tool](https://github.com/w3c/wai-wcag-em-report-tool/) by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Now further developed to make accessibility evaluations faster and consistent as the Accessibility Evaluation Tool.

The current target user is the Accessibility specialist, whom need to audit websites and / or applications conform WCAG and related accessibility directives and guidelines.

The intended target user is anyone that concerns about creating accessible digital products and need a tool to perform accessibility analysis on a regular basis.

As accessibility evaluator, you will be able to download a html report or json data file of the evaluation when done. This report and data can then be used, as example, to create an accessibility statement.
