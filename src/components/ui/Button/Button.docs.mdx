# Buttons

The Button is a user interface that can be clicked.
It emits a click event.
The Button is used for all actions, except for navigation, started by the user.
To navigate, use the Link.

## Default Button

The Default Button must at least have a label, which can added with some textcontent.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />
<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />

## Variants

Basicly there is the Primary Button and the Secondary Button.
The Button has a Small, or condensed, variant.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
    <Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
</Canvas>

The Secondary Button is the default Button.

There can be only one Primary Button within a Context.

There can be multiple contexts for the Button within a Page.

The Page is always the Primary Context.

Nested contexts have Small Buttons of which only one is a Primary Small Button.
